PreventVance AI ‚Äî Leading the Future of Early Health Defense
A comprehensive healthcare management system designed for rural healthcare workers to manage patient diagnostics and care delivery. The system enables early detection and preventive care by identifying individuals at risk of diseases before they become symptomatic.

üéØ Why This Project Matters
Addressing Healthcare Disparities: This project, PreventVance AI, tackles the critical healthcare gap in rural and underserved areas where access to specialized medical care is limited. By leveraging machine learning and AI technologies, we enable healthcare workers to identify patients at risk of developing serious conditions like diabetes, heart disease, liver disorders, and mental health issues before they become symptomatic. This proactive approach not only saves lives but also reduces healthcare costs by preventing complications that require expensive treatments. The system democratizes access to advanced diagnostic capabilities, ensuring that quality healthcare is not just a privilege of urban areas but reaches every corner of our communities, ultimately creating a more equitable healthcare system for all.

üéØ System Overview
Project Goal: Address critical gaps in diagnosis and treatment accessibility by enabling early detection and preventive care, particularly in underserved rural areas.

Target Users:

Primary: Rural healthcare workers who manage patient diagnostics and care delivery

Secondary: Corporate wellness programs seeking employee health monitoring solutions

Value Proposition: Bridge the healthcare delivery gap in rural areas by proactively identifying at-risk individuals before conditions become symptomatic. Transform raw health data into actionable insights, enabling preventive interventions and reducing long-term health complications.

üìä ML Models
The intelligence of this system comes from a rigorous and data-centric ML pipeline. The models used are not just off-the-shelf; they are the "champion" models selected after exhaustive testing.

Real-World, Relevant Data: The models were trained on real-world datasets, including those specific to Indian demographics, to ensure the highest possible accuracy and relevance for the target population.

Rigorous Model Selection: For each of the four disease categories, a wide array of machine learning algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, and LightGBM) were trained, tuned, and evaluated.

Best-in-Class Performance: The system automatically selects and integrates only the best-performing model (based on F1-score and other metrics) for each specific disease. This ensures that the risk prediction for diabetes, for example, uses the most accurate classifier for that unique dataset, which may be different from the best model for heart disease.

This process ensures that PreventVance AI operates with the highest-fidelity predictions possible, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach.

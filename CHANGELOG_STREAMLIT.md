- Added "View Latest Prediction" button for debugging

**Rationale:**
- Ensure data consistency between frontend and backend
- Show computed fields (BMI, A/G ratio) to users before submission
- Provide retry mechanism for failed ML predictions
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 3. `medml-frontend/pages/1_Patient_Dashboard.py`
**Changes Made:**
- Added assessment history section with tabbed interface
- Added retry prediction section for patients without risk data
- Improved handling of missing risk assessment data
- Added "Request New Assessment" and "View Assessment History" buttons

**Rationale:**
- Provide patients with access to their assessment history
- Handle cases where ML predictions haven't been run yet
- Improve user experience for patients without complete assessments

- Database model structures and relationships
- Computed fields (BMI, A/G ratio) formulas

### 2. `BACKEND_DISCOVERY.md`
**Purpose:** Human-readable summary of backend analysis
**Contents:**
- Authentication system details (JWT-based)
- API endpoint categorization and descriptions
- ML prediction system architecture
- Database model relationships
- Security considerations and access control
- External dependencies and configuration requirements

### 3. `tests/streamlit_frontend_checks.py`
**Purpose:** Automated test script for frontend functionality
**Contents:**
- Backend connectivity tests
- Complete admin workflow testing (login, patient creation, assessments, predictions)
- Complete patient workflow testing (login, data access, recommendations)
- PDF generation testing
- Error handling validation

### 4. `run_manual_checks.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive manual test cases
**Contents:**
- 12 detailed test cases covering all user flows
- Step-by-step instructions for each test
- Expected results and success criteria
- Edge case and error handling tests
- Role-based access control validation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Complete User Flows
- **Admin Flow:** Login → Dashboard → Add Patient → Complete Assessments → Trigger Prediction → View Results → Book Consultations → Add Notes
- **Patient Flow:** Login → Dashboard → View Risk Assessment → View Assessment History → Download Reports → View Recommendations

### 2. ML Prediction Integration
- Automatic prediction triggering after assessment completion
- Retry functionality for failed predictions
- Graceful handling of ML model failures
- Prediction status tracking and display

### 3. Computed Fields
- **BMI Calculation:** Real-time calculation in patient creation form
- **A/G Ratio Calculation:** Real-time calculation in liver assessment form
- Validation to ensure calculations match backend formulas

### 4. Assessment Management
- Multi-step assessment forms for all 4 diseases
- Assessment history tracking and display
- Progress indicators and status tracking
- Form validation and error handling

### 5. PDF Report Generation
- Section-based PDF generation
- Download functionality for both admin and patient roles
- Proper file naming and content organization

### 6. Role-Based Access Control
- Admin-only features properly protected
- Patient access limited to own data
- Proper error messages for unauthorized access
- Session management and token handling

### 7. Error Handling and Robustness
- Comprehensive error handling for API failures
- ML prediction failure recovery
- Network connectivity issues handling
- User-friendly error messages

## Backend Integration Details

### API Endpoints Used
- Authentication: `/auth/admin/login`, `/auth/patient/login`, `/auth/me`
- Patient Management: `/patients`, `/patients/{id}`
- Assessments: `/patients/{id}/assessments/{type}`
- Predictions: `/patients/{id}/predict`, `/patients/{id}/predictions/latest`
- Reports: `/patients/{id}/report/pdf`
- Recommendations: `/patients/{id}/recommendations`
- Dashboard: `/dashboard/stats`
- Consultations: `/consultations`, `/consultations/notes`

### Data Validation
- All forms use backend schema validation
- Computed fields calculated identically to backend
- Proper data type handling (boolean vs integer)
- Required field validation

### Security Implementation
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure token storage in session state
- Proper logout and session cleanup

## Testing Coverage

### Automated Tests
- Backend connectivity validation
- Complete admin workflow testing
- Complete patient workflow testing
- API endpoint functionality validation
- Error handling verification

### Manual Tests
- 12 comprehensive test cases
- User interface validation
- Role-based access control testing
- Edge case and error scenario testing
- Computed field validation
- Session management testing

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for AI-generated recommendations
- `SECRET_KEY`: Required for Flask application
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: Required for JWT token generation

### Backend Dependencies
- ML model files in `models_store/` directory
- Database with proper schema and relationships
- Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication
- FPDF for PDF generation

## Known Limitations

1. **ML Model Dependencies:** Predictions may fail if model files are missing
2. **External API Dependencies:** Recommendations require GEMINI_API_KEY
3. **Database Dependencies:** Requires proper database setup and migrations
4. **Session Management:** Tokens expire after 15 minutes (configurable)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket integration for live updates
2. **Advanced Analytics:** More detailed dashboard analytics
3. **Bulk Operations:** Batch patient operations
4. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Better mobile device support
5. **Offline Support:** Cached data for offline viewing

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure backend server is running before starting frontend
2. Verify all ML model files are present
3. Configure environment variables properly
4. Run database migrations if needed
5. Test all user flows before production deployment

## Conclusion

The Streamlit frontend has been successfully implemented with complete HW and Patient user flows, full backend integration, and comprehensive testing coverage. All acceptance criteria have been met, and the application is ready for end-to-end testing and deployment.
